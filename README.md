# MiniProjectGoLangMongo


i have created the miniproject u asked me to do. it is created using mongodb and golang (for routing using gorilla mux ) and i created a Dockerfile to create the image and pushed that image to my docker registry to take the reference during creating deployment file. then i created mongodb.yml file by fetching mongo image and put the name of mongo in specs[env] of golang deployement file to connect them.
